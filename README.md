#My Project

Greeting, Rescue Team.
We lost signal with the Dione colony base two weeks ago. Your mission is to gather intel and rescue any survivors—if any remain.

It might sound trivial, but a food joint from Jupiter recently opened a location on Dione. It's called Saturn Mission Sandwiches.
Could be worth checking out…?

The previous expedition managed to extract partial data from the store's interface. It's... suspicious.

#Program Features
**Add Sandwich and make it Combo** 
Add sandwiches and pay at the end with minerals.
**Add items aside from the sandwichess**
Add a variety of items to the checkout, not only the sandwiches. A possible infestation might have start on a different source of food?
**Get a receipt that will be saved on the ships database** 
After the checkout you should be able to get the receipts, that will help us gathering the data.
**Exit the Application**
User will be able to exit the application without blowing up the entire colony

## Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed making coding the second capstone. I felt better compared to the last one. It was a little bit difficult for me coding the checkout section. 
It was very confusing and I might still have a few errors. I like the theme and I added a little but of immersion.
