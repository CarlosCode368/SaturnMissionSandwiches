#My Project

Greeting, Rescue Team
We lost signal with Dione colony base two weeks ago. Your mission is to gather intel and rescue any survivors if any. 
It might be tivial, but a food joint created in Jupiter had recently opened in Dione. It's called Saturn Mission Sandwiches. 
Maybe is worth checking it out? 

The previous expedition was able to gather some data from the store interface. It's a little bit suspisious

#Program Features
**Add Sandwich and make it Combo** 
Add sandwiches and pay at the end with minerals.
**Add items aside from the sandwichess**
Add a variety of items to the checkout, not only the sandwiches. A possible infestation might have start on a different source of food?
**Get a receipt that will be saved on the ships database** 
After the checkout you should be able to get the receipts, that will help us gathering the data.
**Exit the Application**
User will be able to exit the application without blowing up the entire colony

## Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed making coding the second capstone. I felt better compared to the last one. It was a little bit difficult for me coding the checkout section. 
It was very confusing and I might still have a few errors. I like the theme and I added a little but of immersion.
